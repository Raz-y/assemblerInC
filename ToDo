pre-processor parser
also check line numbers and characters consume for errors
maybe you can create a separate file tracker file

create an error function.

TODO: Continue with macro algorithm
    1) read next line.
    2) if field is macro name switch to content.
    3) if field is "mcr" (else skip to step 6).
    4) switch "has mcr" flag.
    5) there's a macro definition - enter to macro table macro name.
    6) read next line (if EOF skip to step 9) if "has macro flag" is on end no "endmcr" detected -
       enter line to macro content and delete line else (not macro) back to step 1.
    7) if "endmcr" detected - delete tag from file and continue, if not back to step 6.
    8) turn off "has mcr" flag. go back to 1 (finished macro definition save).
    9) finish: save spread macro file.

Note: I stopped at processing the macro when reading mcr --> I need to set up a function that adds a macro
look into creating a sub function to handle it outside of the macroParser.

Need to add saved words list to check macro validation.


I implemented an insert macro function for now (not inserting yet, need to check if we can assume endmcr
is in new line and if not implement accordingly.


Implemented an insert macro and made sure table works fine, created a copy file mechanism.
Need to actually delete the consumed macro line and implement the insert macro and save a copy file.  


macro parser implemented - need to return a file for the second pass.
